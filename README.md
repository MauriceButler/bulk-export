# bulk-export

Requires files in a directory and returns the results as a keyed object

This was kinda of an experiment in removing boilerplate stuff I was typing over an over again when exposing a "namespace" module

Will hopefully automagically load sub files and export them thus removing the painful touch index file every time you add something dance...
